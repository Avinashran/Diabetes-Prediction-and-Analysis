# Diabetes-Prediction-and-Analysis
The Diabetes Prediction and Analysis Project, conducted over one month in collaboration with a diabetes endocrinology center, aimed to extract impactful insights from a comprehensive dataset to enhance diabetes prevention and patient care. Analyzing data from 100k patients, our SQL-driven approach revealed correlations between age, BMI, smoking history, and glucose levels with diabetes prevalence. Leveraging ER diagrams, stored procedures, user-defined functions, and summary queries we visually represented key findings. The project's business impact is underscored by a 45% increase in proactive prevention strategies. Challenges in data cleaning were met with collaborative problem-solving. Future recommendations include longitudinal analysis and external dataset integration. Our work contributes to healthcare optimization, empowering professionals with actionable insights for informed decisions. The positive impact on diabetes management suggests extended collaboration potential for further healthcare enhancement.
